Agricultural practices differ widely across the world. In less developed countries, many farmers use subsistence agriculture and extensive forms of farming that depend on natural conditions for success. In the developed world, farmers adopt more intensive kinds of agriculture using modern irrigation and precision farming methods to increase yields.

Commercial and industrial farming is primarily focused on large-scale food production, while other farming techniques are more environmentally friendly, with an emphasis on sustainable practices and the use of natural fertilizers.
